              I have 4 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
              at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack
              developer, my expertise is in building scalable front-end applications using React and Redux for state management

              I get fascinated when I learn the theory of how the software work. Knowing why it works it's more
              satisfying than just getting it to work.
